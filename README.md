# knockout-cli

A simple CLI initializer for new knockout projects.

**IT'S 2020, SO WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS?**

That's a very good question. The answer: sheer boredom. But also because people still write knockout. This is a simple tool for creating new knockout projects with semi-modern tools without having to fiddle with configuration much. The concept is borrowed from other JS frameworks, like React (create-react-app), Vue (vue-cli), and even Ember (which is heavily CLI-driven).

## Installation
To use knockout-cli, install it globally.

```
yarn add -g knockout-cli
```

## Getting started

You can now use `ko-cli` from the command-line. You can use the `create` command to initialize a new project.

```
ko-cli create my-app
```

Now, `cd` into the new project directory and run `yarn start` to start the development server.
