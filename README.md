# knockout-cli

A simple CLI initializer for new knockout projects.

## Getting started

The easiest way to set up a new project is with `npx`. Use the `create` command to initialize it.

```
npx knockout-cli create my-app
```

Alternatively, install the package globally.

```
yarn global add knockout-cli
```

```
npm install -g knockout-cli
```

Now, `cd` into the new project directory and run `yarn start`/`npm start` to start the development server.

## CLI Reference
